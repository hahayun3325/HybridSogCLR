# Hybrid SogCLR PyTorch Implementation

In this repo, we show how to train a self-supervised model by using Global Contrastive Loss (GCL) on a widely used bimodal image-text dataset [CC3M](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions/download).

## Train model

Execute the `Train.bat` file within this folder. Please pay attention to assigning the correct directory to the `data_path` and `ann_path` variables.

## Evaluate model

Execute the `Eva_imagenet.bat` file within this folder. Please pay attention to assigning the correct directory to the `data_path` and `ann_path` variables.
